a. Investigation on using hadoop with lustre file system. The installation is successful, and so is the wordcount mapreduce job. However, cloudgene still need to acknowledge the availability of HDFS, or otherwise it will deem the hadoop cluster is unavailable. There is a possibility to hack cloudgene code to acknowledge lustre fs, as the replacement of HDFS.
b. Experiment to compare between minimac4 command line with cpu options and cloudgene-hadoop. Cloudgene-hadoop, performance much better with more mappers.
c. Experiment to compare minimac4 command line with mpi and cloudgene-hadoop. Command line with mpi performs better.
d. There are 2(two) versions of Minimac4. One from imputation-server, the other one is from minimac4.
e. Investigation on LASER association server.
